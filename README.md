Audio Transcription App

Objective : Audio Transcription App is a user-friendly application designed to convert audio files into text. 
By leveraging advanced machine learning models, this app provides accurate and efficient transcription services.
Users can simply upload their audio files, and the app will process and display the transcribed text.

Technologies Used: 
PyTorch: An open-source machine learning library that provides tools for developing and training deep learning models.
Transformers:A library by Hugging Face that offers a wide range of pre-trained models for various natural language processing tasks. In this project, it is used for automatic speech recognition (ASR).
Gradio:A Python library that simplifies the creation of user interfaces for machine learning models, making it easy to upload audio files and view transcriptions.
OpenAI Whisper Model: A pre-trained model specifically designed for automatic speech recognition. It ensures high accuracy in transcribing spoken language into text.
